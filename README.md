# POC of Splitting IP Address Ranges -- BETA.

- Creates several subsets of IP Addresses, by counting the subnet sizes.
- Calculates ideal subset using Subnet Splitting, BlackJack mechanics, and Round-Robin to clear the remaining entries from the list. 

- Needs further testing to ensure that subset manipulation doesn't result in an inflated Scope.
